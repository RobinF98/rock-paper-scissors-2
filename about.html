      <p>
        Rock Paper Scissors 2 is a challenge I set for myself to test and expand my front end coding abilities
        I wanted to try something a little different to what I have done in the past, and have a lot of ideas to
        implement on this site.
        The trick to getting a good project out there is to know what to focus on, and what leave for another update
        after release, and this is something I am still getting the hang of
