# Rock Paper Scissors 2

---

An interactive web game for playing Rock, Paper, Scissors, with a twist.
In this gamem, the user selects the move they want to make (traditionally either Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer will pick a random move in response. The normal rock paper scissors rules apply, and a round winner is selected.

BUT this game has an extra option: You can play with 5 weapons, instead of the usual 3. Spock and Lizard are added to the game, and allow for many more possibilities in game play and outcomes.
In theory, you could add any number of extra weapons, as long as the total count remains an odd number. There is definitely opportunity here to allow the user to define their own extra weapons, and expand the game complexity almost indefinitely.

## Bugs

---

* Set difficulty selector reverts to previous value when game resets due to changing difficulty
  * Fix: Removed code to set difficulty selector to old value
